# CIS-3515-SignUpForm

This is an Android application to collect a user’s name, email, a password, and a password 
confirmation on its main activity. It also contains a Save button.
When the user clicks the Save button, it displays a message containing the user’s name, welcoming 
them to the app. e.g. “Welcome, Jayne Dough, to the SignUpForm App”
